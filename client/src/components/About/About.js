      <h1>About Us</h1>
      Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian Economy"- said Mahatma Gandhi
      six decades ago. Even today, the situation is still the same, with almost
      the entire economy being sustained by agriculture, which is the mainstay
      of the villages. It contributes 16% of the overall GDP and accounts for
      employment of approximately 52% of the Indian population. Rapid growth in
      agriculture is essential not only for self-reliance but also to earn
      valuable foreign exchange. Government has many schemes, offers,
      facilities, insurance policies, and many more schemes for the betterment
      of agriculture and yet somehow the farmers are still facing the problems.
      True, that natural factors such as drought, snowfall, heavy rainfall
      sandstorms, cyclones, and other natural calamities are out of the control
      of the government, but still, they are the ones that inflict the most
      damages to the standing crops in the field. Although the government has
      plans and insurance policies for such conditions it is not widely known by
      the farming community. One of the other big problems is that farmers in
      India are less educated and donâ€™t have any idea regarding the facilities
      that are being provided by the government. As most of the farmers in India
      reside in the countryside or in the villages these facilities are very
      far-fetched for them. But time changes, and as technology is now reaching
      everywhere farmers are not lagging in this. The best example is the
      smartphone, now almost everyone in the country has a smartphone or at
      least a smartphone in one house, which makes it easy for them to know
      about happening all around and to the exciting new opportunities and
      facilities that are being provided by the government for the help of
      farmers. This will make matters easy for the scientists to reach the
      farmers in the field, where they can implement new methods and technology
      for growing crops and agriculture. Through our website farmers can access
      it from their smartphone to analyze the condition and situation of their
      place and will help them to decide on which crops and plants they should
      invest in during that time so as to gain maximum profit from his
      investment.
